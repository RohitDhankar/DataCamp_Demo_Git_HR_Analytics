### Predicting Employee Attrition

### Prequisites for this Course
- **Data Camp Courses** The learners should have already undergone these courses:- 
- Python Basics
- Intro to Stats 101 ?? ---- TBD 
- Any other Relevant Course ?? ---- TBD 


### Chapter 1: Broad Scope 

- **Intro** Predicting Employee Attrition.
- **Descriptive Statistics**
  - Common statistical descriptions of Data. Measures of central tendency - mean,median,mode, variance and correlation.
  - Our dataset is fairly small -thus we provide descriptive stats for complete data. 
  - Mostly , Bi-variate analysis. We compare correlation of Two variables i.e:- Salary Hikes vs. Attrition.
  - Certain cases of Multi-variate analysis. All variable correlation plots.
- **Predictive Statistics**
  - Classification of dependent variable basis independent variables.
  - Ensemble classifiers.
  - ____________TBD
